// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

function evenOrOdd(num):

params: num

odd = num % (modulus) 2 != 0
even = num % 2 == 0

if odd:
	print "odd num."
else:
	print "even num."

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)
b) ->

-Ask for an array of numbers
-Sum the numbers array
-Get a count of the total number of numbers in the array
-Calculate average
-print the avg to the console.

c) -> 

-Ask for an array of numbers
-Loop through each item at a time in the array; if the current num was > the previous num, save the current num as 'largest'. If the current num is < the previous num, save the current num as 'smallest.'
-Print smallest or largest to console.
